## Our Map

### Team: Aiko and Charlie

The app:
- Location based social media platform
- Share memories and stories connected with specific places - we will be implementing the Google maps API as well as Firebase.
- View other people’s posts by looking at a shared map and clicking on location pointers
- Shared memories/stories will be markers on maps
- The app will support uploading text, pictures, and videos
- Users can comment on other people’s posts
- For the purposes of this project, there will be one shared map for Dartmouth students, but it will be written in a way to ease scaling upwards and allow individuals and groups to create their own maps
- Method to export a post into a file

Moving forward:
- Aiko will work on using the MLKit API to tag posts and create a method to search and filter posts. 
- Charlie will on making the framework of the posts and allow it to accept different types of media.
- We will both work on getting the Firebase to work. 
- We will both work on UI. 

Show and Tell 2:
- We will have posts working, so that we can post different types of media on the app to the Firebase - ran into complications
- Firebase will be working for registering users and posting information

To Do:
- Try to bring project back from the dead
- Learn to do Git
- Finish database
- Add user profiles to database
- Load photos/videos to database 
- Group markers on map
- Make explore page with highlights and suggestions -> create algorithm/method to tailor thes posts to the user
- Finish up MLKit
- External sharing to other social media platforms
- Brush up UI

Things we have learned from first portion of project:
- Divide up work better. Don't divide up work based on amount of time, but on what makes sense-do stuff in terms of order
- Start a little bit earlier on the work in case of complications.
- Get the git stuff together. 

Work Breakdown:
We mostly worked together. Even when one person started something, the other would help if any issues popped up. We were really collaborative throughout the whole process. We worked together for hours and hours on Tuesday debugging. 

Aiko:
-Worked on getting the database set up. This included making the posts and creating the structure for them to be posted. This also included figuring out how to get the photos to upload.
-Worked on getting the posts to show up on the map and what to do when a marker on the map is pressed.

Charlie:
-Worked on the loaders for loading the posts from the database. This was a really long process to get it to kind of work.
-Worked on the history fragment and getting that to work with the loader.
-Worked on getting the UI to look better.
-Worked really hard on Wednesday morning to get everything together.

Notes about the APK:
-We have a lot of code, but not a lot of app.
-We left the code that didn't end up fully working as comments so that you can see what we tried to do.
-Sometimes things don't work quite right--try running it again.
