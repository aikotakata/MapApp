## Our Map

### Team: Aiko and Charlie

The app:
- Location based social media platform
- Share memories and stories connected with specific places - we will be implementing the Google maps API as well as Firebase.
- View other people’s posts by looking at a shared map and clicking on location pointers
- Shared memories/stories will be markers on maps
- The app will support uploading text, pictures, and videos
- Users can comment on other people’s posts
- For the purposes of this project, there will be one shared map for Dartmouth students, but it will be written in a way to ease scaling upwards and allow individuals and groups to create their own maps
- Method to export a post into a file

Moving forward:
- Aiko will work on using the MLKit API to tag posts and create a method to search and filter posts. 
- Charlie will on making the framework of the posts and allow it to accept different types of media.
- We will both work on getting the Firebase to work. 
- We will both work on UI. 

Show and Tell 2:
- We will have posts working, so that we can post different types of media on the app to the Firebase - ran into complications
- Firebase will be working for registering users and posting information

To Do:
- Try to bring project back from the dead
- Learn to do Git
- Finish database
- Add user profiles to database
- Load photos/videos to database 
- Group markers on map
- Make explore page with highlights and suggestions -> create algorithm/method to tailor thes posts to the user
- Finish up MLKit
- External sharing to other social media platforms
- Brush up UI

Things we have learned from first portion of project:
- Divide up work better. Don't divide up work based on amount of time, but on what makes sense-do stuff in terms of order
- Start a little bit earlier on the work in case of complications.
- Get the git stuff together.
