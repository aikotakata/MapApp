## Our Map

### Team: Aiko and Charlie

The app:
- Location based social media platform
- Share memories and stories connected with specific places - we will be implementing the Google maps API as well as Firebase.
- View other people’s posts by looking at a shared map and clicking on location pointers
- Shared memories/stories will be markers on maps
- The app will support uploading text, pictures, and videos
- Users can comment on other people’s posts
- For the purposes of this project, there will be one shared map for Dartmouth students, but it will be written in a way to ease scaling upwards and allow individuals and groups to create their own maps
- Method to export a post into a file
